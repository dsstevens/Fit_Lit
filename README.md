## Introduction

This project involved creating a Fitbit or Strava-like activity tracker. We were given data for many users over a series of dates.  Our goal was to log the data and present it in an easy-to-read and well-organized fashion on a dashboard for users. The dashboard allows a user to view and see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones.

## Learning Goals

Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity.
Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
Make network requests to retrieve data.
Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.

### Challenges


## Setup

1. *fork* this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.
1. clone down the _forked_ repo. Since you don't want to name your project "activity-tracker-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
1. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use.   
1. Make sure both members of your team are collaborators on the forked repo.  
1. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`.  This will update to the latest version of packages.  We need to be using `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` which is not the latest version.  If you start to run into Webpack errors, first check that all group members are using the correct version.

The details of this project are outlined in [this project spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html).

work together as much as we can, either as all 4 or paired.  if you write something on your own, meet and go over it together and debrief everyone on the code.

TDD: write each test for the function and test it before moving on

DOM manipulation: HTML, CSS, eventlisteners and JS in ES6

Network requests, server data in second half

GIt flow: branches and commits as atomic as possible, equitable share of commits and PRs.

Communicate when merged to main so everyone is updated on main. Spread the pushes and commits equitably to reflect a division of labor.

Run npm start in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page). Control + C is the command to stop running the local server. Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use.
